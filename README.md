# what-am-i-reading-frontend
Hello, Hola, Salut, Willkommen

Friends, Romans, Countrymen

This is a web site that tracks what I am reading over a period of time and whether I am on pace to finish on time.

Work in progress. Nothing in this codebase is necessarily well organized nor necessarily best practice at the moment. I spun this up to have an idea of what my backend API should look like. Once that is done, I will come back and clean this app up.

Furthermore I did not finish developing my backend by the end of the year 2020 as was the plan so I was forced to hard code a whole lot of data in order to deploy the website at the begining of the year 2021.

I ask that you not look in the `temp` branch for, as the name indicates, it is only temporary and contains a plethora of, previously mentioned, hard coded values. But of course, this is a public repository and you are an autonomous individual and can do whatever you want. This is the branch I am currently using to feed into the `gh-pages` branch that I use to deploy this website. I am particularly aware of the **52** item list of books that is hard coded on that branch and would 
appreciate you not calling me out on it because I do plan on making that a more dynamic operation once my backend is finished. But of course autonomous individual etc... 

You are welcome to call me out on my lack of commenting and documentation in this repository, and I welcome any advice or suggestions you can give on how to improve my code and organization. The `main` branch should provide enough context to have an idea of what the deployed website shows. The plan is to deploy off the `main` branch eventually, but, alas, unfinished backend and hardcoded data and what not.
