# what-am-i-reading-frontend
A web site that tracks what I am reading over a period of time and whether I am on pace to finish on time.

Work in progress. Nothing in this codebase is well organized yet nor necessarily best practice. I spun this up to have an idea of what my backend API should look like. Once that is done, I will come back and clean this app up.
